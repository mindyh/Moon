I am a self-professed geek. But I never dreamed that I&#8217;d get so far into a fandom that I&#8217;d cosplay for it. Until the lastest arc in the Naruto anime, which was all about Kakashi&#8217;s time in the ANBU. And that was when I decided that this summer I will create an ANBU uniform. Â It will be the first and likely last costume I will ever make, but it will happen.

I decided on cosplaying as an ANBU operative because&#8230;

  * It looks badass.
  * The ANBU are badass.
  * The uniform is surprisingly practical in combat (except for the open-toed sandals)
  * It&#8217;s relatively simple to make (compared to other anime costumes)
  * It&#8217;s damn badass.

I did a bit of research, and drew up some plans:

I currently don&#8217;t have a design for the mask, I&#8217;m trying to think of a cool animal that hasn&#8217;t been taken yet.

I also currently have no clue HOW I&#8217;m going to accomplish this (having very little experience sewing things), so wish me luck!
