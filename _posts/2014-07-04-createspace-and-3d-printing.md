If you&#8217;ve read my other post, you&#8217;ll know that this summer my side project is to [make a cosplay](http://mindyhuang.me/2014/06/09/cosplay/ "Cosplay???"). More generally, my project is just learning how to Make things.

It was a sort of vague and general idea in my head, until I found out about
the Garage &#8211; Google&#8217;s very own makerspace! They have CNC machines, sewing/embroidery machines, 3D printers, laser cutters &#8211; you name it, they have it. Now, I&#8217;m on a mission to learn how to use ALL of the machines. I even persuaded my team to let me use a laser cutter for one of my intern projects >:D. That cosplay is SO happening.

Well, today is Fourth of July Eve, which apparently is considered a holiday at Google. I decided to go into the office anyways, but not to work &#8211; to learn how to use the 3D printer.

I was all set to go to work on a holiday, when I recalled that Stanford also had a free 3D printer somewhere. After poking around a bit, I found the ](http://acomp.stanford.edu/createspace/ "createspace") in Meyer library, complete with a 3D printer, a 3D scanner, a humungous graphic design tablet and an Arduino station. So I&#8217;m currently sitting not at Google, but at Meyer, watching the MakerBot Replicator2 do its thing.

This is my first time 3D printing anything, so it took a bit of reading manuals and trial and error to get things working. But MakerBot really outdid itself with how user friendly its products are!

It&#8217;s done! If you can&#8217;t tell, I printed a lithopane of my parents. It&#8217;s a birthday present for my father &#8211; his birthday is today! (Model from the [MakerBot Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:74322))

Well, I suddenly have a lot of ideas for 3D printing. So I&#8217;ll definitely be back here! Next step: figuring out how to change the spool and print multi-colored objects.
