This quarter I&#8217;m taking CS148 &#8211; Introduction to Graphics. What this really means is introduction to 3D Modelling and Maya, with some shaders thrown in.

This post is about the first of two images we need to make in the class. For this one, we have to create an image using scanline rendering. We implemented our own BRDF shader based off of Epic Game&#8217;s shaders, and were allowed to use that and/or the given BlinnPhong shaders to create our render. I definitely learned a lot, but as I usually do with art projects I may have gone overboard with it &#8211; this project cost me quite a bit of sleep&#8230;

**Inspiration**
  
The idea for this image came from searching through online models for inspiration and finding ones for all the Avengers.

**Modelling**
  
I downloaded Iron Man in .max format; Hawkeye, Captain, Thor, and Hulk in .dae format, and Black Widow in .mesh.ascii format. I posed them with 3DS Max and XNALara before exporting them out as .obj and importing them into Maya to place them for the final scene. I initially tried posing in Maya as well, but ran into issues where Maya would mess up the skeleton and the mesh groups and textures and many, many other things. It was solved by importing everything into 3DS Max and using its .obj converter instead.

My own mesh is the destroyed building on the left &#8211; I built it and ripped holes in it with Maya.

**Shading**
  
I initially started using a BlinnPhong shader, but ended up switching almost every mesh to the Epic shader. The only meshes still using BlinnPhong are flat images (like the sky and explosions), and Thor because his mesh reacted oddly to Epic lighting.

**Texturing**
  
Each character came with their own textures in .mtl files, so I needed to get .mtl functionality working with EpicShader. A slightly tricky part was that Iron Man&#8217;s .mtl file only had colors, no mapped texture images, so I needed to add a way to pass those colors into the shader.

Most of the buildings came from a mesh pack. I textured my building with a cracked concrete image I found online.

The sky is a plane with a cool image on it. The explosions are planes as well with just the explosion image carved out &#8211; I subdivided the plane many times and deleted the &#8220;pixels&#8221; that were supposed to be transparent. To make the intersection between the explosions and the buildings less awkward, I mutated the faces of the buildings so it doesn&#8217;t look like a straight line.
