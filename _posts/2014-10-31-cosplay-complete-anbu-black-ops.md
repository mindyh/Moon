Remember 4 months ago when I said I wanted to do a cosplay? Well I have a bad habit of brainstorming projects but not actually doing them. This time though, this time it actually happened.

<span class="fbPhotoCaptionText">I haven&#8217;t sewn since 5th grade colonial day when they forced us to.</span> Things I learned in the course of this project:

  * What patterning is. Special thanks to Jeff for that, <span class="fbPhotoCaptionText">I literally would have had no idea where to start if you hadn&#8217;t sat me down and just started patterning.</span>
  * How to use sewing machine. Much thanks to Google&#8217;s Garage for providing a textile lab. I spent a lot of time there after work during the summer.
  * Hot glue doesn&#8217;t work too well with pleather.
  * You can totally cut up your shoes if you need them in a different style. This simple realization opened up so many doors.
  * Model Magic is magical, but dissolves in water (like condensation from your breath in the mask). Remember to seal ALL of it with paint!

In case you&#8217;re curious and/or need pointers like I did:

  * Mask was made with a standard plastic halloween mask with Crayola Model Magic on top. (I only used one 4oz bag) Sealed with white acrylic paint which gave it the shiny look and decorated with red and black paint.

  * Sandals were made by buying cheap pleather boots from Amazon, cutting out the toes, and covering it all with more pleather to achieve the look.
  * Gloves were bought and painted with black acrylic paint to remove the glossiness.
  * Vest &#8211; tailor made by me! Added batting and foam inside so it looks as thick as is does in the show
  <img class="alignnone wp-image-463 size-large" src="http://s416.photobucket.com/albums/pp249/KCHuang/Blog/IMG_20140827_174242_nopm_-e1420583048313.jpg" alt="IMG_20140827_174242_nopm_" />

  * Pants were cargo pants bought off of Amazon.
  * Bandages were made by cutting up old t-shirts.
  * Tattoo was stenciled on with liquid eyeliner.

And&#8230;I believe that&#8217;s it! I didn&#8217;t do any of the accessories because I ran out of time. Happy Halloween!
