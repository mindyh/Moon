Today I graduated with my masters degree in computer science. This marks the end of my 5 years at Leland Stanford Jr. University. But I don't really feel sad that I'm leaving - maybe it's because I've already used up all my nostalgia last year. Or maybe it's because I'll be back in 3 months anyways, just down the street at Google working on cooler projects with less homework. Yeah, that's probably it.

This summer I'll be doing the post grad travel thing, and drawing a lot. Also working on a BB8 robot project with my lil' bro. Anyways, I'll see you around.
