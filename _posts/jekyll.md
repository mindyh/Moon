Today my Bluehost expires, so I spent all day trying to figure out where I should host my website. Wordpress was alright, but also a bit clunky and more costly than I'd like to host. After some research, I decided on Jekyll/Github pages. 

I was drawn to it because I already have experience with Rails and am a fan of Github, thus rendering the learning curve very small. I have to say that so far it is rather easy to use, now that I'm finally done migrating old content over and relinking things. Sublime was very helpful in that domain.

I am using the [http://taylantatli.me/Moon/](Moon theme by Taylan TatlÄ±). Definitely give their stuff a look, it's all very polished and snazzy looking.
