Declared Electrical Engineering today, due to logistical reasons that made it far more reasonable to do an EE major with a focus on CS than a CS major with a focus on EE. For some reason it&#8217;s a lot more exciting than when I declared Computer Science last year. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m growing younger at heart. Maybe it&#8217;s because I got a free t-shirt.
