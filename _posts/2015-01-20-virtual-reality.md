My senior project is with the OCULUS RIFT. Â I cannot begin to convey my excitement. Our project is to add a plugin to the Unreal Engine to support content creation for VR, while in VR. Think, Tony Stark. The heart of the project lies in finding a good control scheme, as there is no standard UX for this medium yet.
