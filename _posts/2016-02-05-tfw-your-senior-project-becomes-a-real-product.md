So Epic Games totally just released their version of [my senior project.](http://mindyhuang.me/unrealvr/#more-493) Check it out.

My project was sponsored Epic, exploring how to do level-building in VR. So to see their super-polished demo basically using [all the results of our research](https://unrealvr.wordpress.com/2016/02/04/you-know-youve-made-it-when/) and demos was pretty damn satisfying.  I can now say in job interviews that I prototyped a thing for Epic Games and it became a real product.
