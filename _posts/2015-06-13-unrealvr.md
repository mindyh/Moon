## What&#8217;s a JARVIS?

These past two quarters (that&#8217;s half a year, wow!), I have devoted more than a fair amount of time to my senior project, affectionately codenamed JARVIS. If you want an in-depth description of the project, read all about our journey, and get access to all our documentation,  [check out the team blog here](https://unrealvr.wordpress.com/), and [our github here.](https://github.com/cs210/Jarvis)

tl;dr &#8211; we partnered with Epic Games, conducted UI/UX research in the fascinatingly unknown field of virtual reality, and built a kickass Worldbuilder. Watch our totally not cheesy video introduction below.



Also, let it be known that our project won an Industry Award from Facebook for Best Virtual Reality Project at the Software Faire. Woo!

## What was the coolest part of the project?

For me, the coolest part of the project was definitely thinking up and testing out new ways to interact with a virtual environment, especially since these paradigms don&#8217;t yet exist. Examples of questions we faced were:

  * What is the best way to pick up an object and move it around?
  * What if you wanted to pick up a really far away object and bring it closer to you?
  * What&#8217;s the best way to move yourself around a potentially enormous world without taking forever while still allowing for fine-tune navigation as you create objects? And how do you do all this without inducing nausea?
  * What does snap-to-grid actually mean in a 3D space?
  * Gazeable menus seem to be all the rage these days in VR demos, but is it actually the best way to interact with menu systems?
  * And of course, what&#8217;s the best motion controller currently out on the market to use?

Some of these are answered in our blog (and some specifically addressed [in this post](https://unrealvr.wordpress.com/2015/05/22/jarvis-special-taking-features-3d/)), but there are many, many other questions that remain. Design for virtual reality right now is akin to designing for tablets 5 years ago when the iPad first came out &#8211;  we are on the cusp of standardizing a new way to interact with information. Though the project is technically over, I&#8217;ve been inspired to continue the research as an independent study under the Jay Borenstein, the instructor I took this class with, and definitely keep up our  connections with Epic Games and Sixense.

## What was the biggest lesson you learned?

I accidentally learned what PMs, tech leads, and managers all do. Simultaneously. x_x But I also learned that I liked being in those positions.

As I was the one one the team most excited about the project, I found myself naturally doing a lot of researching and brainstorming and initiating discussions with teammates and instructors and outsiders alike. As the weeks passed and we gathered feedback from user testers, this naturally evolved into ongoing feature planning and cutting. I really really really enjoyed figuring out what the end product should be like as well as constantly iterating on the design based on user feedback.

Since I had the clearest vision of how all the features would interact and I had not yet mastered the art of delegation, I ended up also architecting the entire program. This was a really fun challenge. We were largely programming in Blueprint (UE4&#8217;s graphical programming interface) which none of us have used before,  so I spent hours reading tutorials and poking through examples to try to understand the paradigms of the language. This extra planning saved us a lot of debugging hassle, which we were very grateful for when we heard stories of other teams who dove in headfirst. It also accidentally made me the person most knowledgeable of the system as a whole, which ended up with me in charge of organizing the technical side as well.

However, by far the hardest thing I had to do during this project was learn how to manage a team. I learned quickly that a system based purely on the volunteering for work was prone to explosive outbursts, and needed to figure out ASAP how delegate work in a way that kept each person engaged with the project and suited to their workstyle, yet was still a fair share of the workload (ex. what sort of work can you give to the member who can&#8217;t make most of the meetings to keep them feeling like an integral part of the team? And how do I keep the workaholic from poaching those projects?) However, with some conflict intervention and careful work assignment, we eventually became the team that won an award from Facebook and mad props from our instructor for turning our project trajectory around.

## Concluding thoughts

This project was by far the longest, most taxing, and most rewarding piece of software I&#8217;ve ever worked on. Up until now, I&#8217;d never worked on a single piece of software so large, never been on a 5-person software team, and never worked on a single project for over 20 weeks. I went from knowing nothing about Virtual Reality to understanding the complete history, the work done in the field so far, the current problems, the amazing potential, and all the nuances of trying to develop for this new technology. The skills I learned, both technical and personal, as well as the inspiration to dive ever deeper into the field of VR &#8211; these are the things I&#8217;ll carry out of this project and into the future.
