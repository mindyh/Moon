Today my Bluehost expires, so I spent all day trying to figure out where I should host my website. Wordpress was alright, but also a bit clunky and more costly than I'd like to host. After some research, I decided on Jekyll/Github pages. I have to say that so far it is rather easy to use, now that I'm finally done migrating old content over and relinking things. Sublime was very helpful in that domain.

I am using the [http://taylantatli.me/Moon/](Moon theme by Taylan TatlÄ±). Definitely give their stuff a look, it's all very polished and snazzy looking.

It makes me so ridiculously happy that I can call my blog a codebase and link someone to it on Github. #geekingout
