A list of my projects through the years. Some of them link to blog posts I wrote about them.

 * **Google Software Engineering Intern **(Summer 2015) &#8211; An image reconstruction project with new technology. That&#8217;s about as much as I can say. (C++)

  * **[UnrealVR](/unrealvr/)** (Winter & Spring 2015)– Led team of five to create a level builder in virtual reality using the Unreal Engine for Oculus Rift and Razer Hydra. Outside of team and product management, was also in charge of overall architecture, UI/UX design, implementing the menu systems, and more. Won Facebook award for best VR project at demo. Also Epic used it as a basis for [their newest UE feature.](/tfw-your-senior-project-becomes-a-real-product/) (C++, Blueprint)

  * **Google Software Engineering Intern ** (Summer 2014) &#8211; Added targeted noise tests to robotic testing suite used on Chromebook touchpads/touchscreens. Circuitry prototyped on breadboard. [See the open source code](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=mindyh&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Stars+ReleaseBlock+Cr+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&cells=tiles). (Python, Arduino)

  * **[Stanford Solar Car Project](http://solarcar.stanford.edu/)** (Fall 2013 to Spring 2015) &#8211; Every two years, Stanford participates in a race of solar-powered cars. I am an embedded programmer on this team. Projects include programming the car headlights to dim as they overheat, sending messages over CAN, debugging the new Battery Management System board, and most recently creating a black box that records all the data of the car. (C).

  * **[TetrisBot](/tetrisbot/)** (Fall 2014) &#8211; Led team of three to simulate and program a PUMA arm to play real-life Tetris. Used concepts such as task/joint space, compliance, singularities, etc. (C++)

  * **[RageQuit](/experimental-haptics-rage-quit/ "Experimental Haptics: Rage Quit") **(Spring 2014) &#8211; Created a virtual haptic environment for the Novint Falcon using modeling event-tapping and fracturing feedback. See abstract at: Chai3D and PhysX tosimulate smashing objects. In charge of modeling event-tapping and fracturing feedback. (C++)

  * **[BitBot](/introduction-to-mechatronics/ "Introduction to Mechatronics")** (Winter 2014) &#8211; Final project of Intro to Mechatronics. Was lead programmer, in charge of architecture, developing, and testing. (Arduino)

  * **DreamConnect** (2013 &#8211; 2014) &#8211; A web app to connect immigrant students with mentors. I write and manage the backend functionality. Features include user authentication, saving profiles, messaging and email, searching for other users, and an administration. Developed with the Haas Center for public service. (Ruby on Rails)

  * **<a href="/downloads/HuangLing-OptimizingPublicTransit.pdf" target="_blank">Optimizing Public Transit</a>** (Fall 2013) &#8211; A project for my machine learning class. Given data on a city&#8217;s demographics, shops, etc., find the optimal locations to place stations for a light rail transit system. Read the report <a title="CS229 Final Report" href="/downloads/HuangLing-OptimizingPublicTransit.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. (Matlab, Python, Machine Learning)

  * **[Hapkit](/tag/hapkit/) **(Fall 2013) &#8211; built and programmed a [Haptic Paddle](http://hapkit.stanford.edu/) for an online no-credit class (Introduction to Haptics). Read my coverage of it [here](/tag/hapkit/). (Arduino)

  * **Amplifier** (Fall 2013) &#8211; Designed and built a dual-channel amplifier board. My first foray into designing and soldering circuit boards. See diagram for a single channel <a title="Amplifier Diagram" href="/downloads/amplifier.png" target="_blank">here</a>.

  * **Modeling Camera Frustum**  (Summer 2013) &#8211; A project assigned to me as an intern in Airware. Given the angle of the drone and the gimble the camera was attached to, project the camera&#8217;s FOV onto the map in the UI so that the pilot knows where the camera is pointing. My first successful brush with linear algebra. (C#, WPF)

  * **StarCommand** (Spring 2013) &#8211; A hardware version of the mobile game Spaceteam. Built during a hackathon with technology from Electric Imp. A write up of this project will happen eventually. (Squirrel, Javascript, PHP)

  * **[Jquery Infographic](/mbti/)**(Winter 2013) &#8211; An interactive infographic on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. (HTML5, CSS3, JQuery)

  * **Boeing Intern** (Summer 2012) – Wrote tools in support of a team  integrating CAD/CAM applications used on the Boeing 787. (C#, VBScript)
