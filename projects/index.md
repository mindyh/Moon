A list of my technical projects through the years, with links as available.

 * **[Attributing Art to Artists: Who Drew It?](https://github.com/mindyh/mindyh.github.io/raw/master/assets/docs/cs231a-final-project.pdf)** (_Spring 2016_) &#8211; A project for a Computer Vision class - using computer vision to extract features, we ran classifiers to attempt to identify whether or not a piece belonged in an artist's gallery, logistic regression gave F1 score of 0.81. Writeup will happen(_?_) (_Python, OpenCV, scikit-learn_)

 * **Protect the Tanto:VR** (_Fall 2015_) &#8211; a simple reflex game for Cardboard. Writeup will happen(_?_) （_Unity for Cardboard_)

 * **Google Software Engineering Intern **(_Summer 2015_) &#8211; An image reconstruction project with new technology. That&#8217;s about as much as I can say. (_C++_)

  * **[UnrealVR](/unrealvr/)** (_Winter & Spring 2015_)– Led team of five to create a level builder in virtual reality using the Unreal Engine for Oculus Rift and Razer Hydra. Outside of team and product management, was also in charge of overall architecture, UI/UX design, implementing the menu systems, and more. Won Facebook award for best VR project at demo. Also Epic used it as a basis for [their newest UE feature.](/tfw-your-senior-project-becomes-a-real-product/) (_C++, Blueprint_)

  * **Google Software Engineering Intern ** (_Summer 2014_) &#8211; Added targeted noise tests to robotic testing suite used on Chromebook touchpads/touchscreens. Circuitry prototyped on breadboard. [See the open source code](_https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=mindyh&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Stars+ReleaseBlock+Cr+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&cells=tiles_). (_Python, Arduino_)

  * **[Stanford Solar Car Project](http://solarcar.stanford.edu/)** (_Fall 2013 to Spring 2015_) &#8211; Every two years, Stanford participates in a race of solar-powered cars. I am an embedded programmer on this team. Projects include programming the car headlights to dim as they overheat, sending messages over CAN, debugging the new Battery Management System board, and most recently creating a black box that records all the data of the car. (_C_).

  * **[TetrisBot](/tetrisbot/)** (_Fall 2014_) &#8211; Led team of three to simulate and program a PUMA arm to play real-life Tetris. Used concepts such as task/joint space, compliance, singularities, etc. (_C++_)

  * **[RageQuit](/experimental-haptics-rage-quit/) **(_Spring 2014_) &#8211; Created a virtual haptic environment for the Novint Falcon using modeling event-tapping and fracturing feedback. See abstract at: Chai3D and PhysX tosimulate smashing objects. In charge of modeling event-tapping and fracturing feedback. (_C++_)

  * **[BitBot](/introduction-to-mechatronics/)** (_Winter 2014_) &#8211; Final project of Intro to Mechatronics. Was lead programmer, in charge of architecture, developing, and testing. (_Arduino_)

  * **DreamConnect** (_2013 &#8211; 2014_) &#8211; A web app to connect immigrant students with mentors. I write and manage the backend functionality. Features include user authentication, saving profiles, messaging and email, searching for other users, and an administration. Developed with the Haas Center for public service. (_Ruby on Rails_)

  * **[Optimizing Public Transit](https://github.com/mindyh/mindyh.github.io/raw/master/assets/docs/HuangLing-OptimizingPublicTransit.pdf)** (_Fall 2013_) &#8211; A project for my machine learning class. Given data on a city&#8217;s demographics, shops, etc., find the optimal locations to place stations for a light rail transit system. (_Matlab, Python, Machine Learning_)

  * **[Hapkit](/my-hapkit-journey-assembly/) **(_Fall 2013_) &#8211; built and programmed a [Haptic Paddle](_http://hapkit.stanford.edu/) for an online no-credit class (_Introduction to Haptics_). (_Arduino_)

  * **Amplifier** (_Fall 2013_) &#8211; Designed and built a dual-channel amplifier board. My first foray into designing and soldering circuit boards. See diagram for a single channel <a title="Amplifier Diagram" href="/downloads/amplifier.png" target="_blank">here</a>.

  * **Modeling Camera Frustum**  (_Summer 2013_) &#8211; A project assigned to me as an intern in Airware. Given the angle of the drone and the gimble the camera was attached to, project the camera&#8217;s FOV onto the map in the UI so that the pilot knows where the camera is pointing. My first successful brush with linear algebra. (_C#, WPF_)

  * **StarCommand** (_Spring 2013_) &#8211; A hardware version of the mobile game Spaceteam. Built during a hackathon with technology from Electric Imp. A write up of this project will happen eventually. (_Squirrel, Javascript, PHP_)

  * **[Jquery Infographic](/mbti/)**(_Winter 2013_) &#8211; An interactive infographic on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. (_HTML5, CSS3, JQuery_)

  * **Boeing Intern** (_Summer 2012_) – Wrote tools in support of a team  integrating CAD/CAM applications used on the Boeing 787. (_C#, VBScript_)
